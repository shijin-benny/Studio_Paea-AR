# Quick start

1. **Install and run**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Add images**
   - `public/images/hero.jpg` — hero for the home page
   - Project images as in `lib/projects.ts` (e.g. `project-1-1.jpg`, `project-1-2.jpg`)

3. **Routes**
   - Home: `/`
   - Work (all): `/work`
   - Work by category: `/work/architecture`, `/work/interiors`, `/work/landscape`

Home is a single hero; work and category links open the gallery (main image + thumbnails).
