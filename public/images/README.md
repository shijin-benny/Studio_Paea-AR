# Image Assets

## Hero
- `hero.png` — Homepage full-screen hero (set to ARC_8).

## Gallery by category

Images are organized by folder; the gallery uses them by category:

| Folder | Category   | Used on |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **AT** | Architecture | `/work/architecture` |
| **IN** | Interiors     | `/work/interiors` |
| **LN** | Landscape     | `/work/landscape` |

- **AT** = Architecture — place architecture images in `AT/`.
- **IN** = Interiors — place interior images in `IN/`.
- **LN** = Landscape — place landscape images in `LN/`.

Project list and image paths are defined in `lib/projects.ts`. Add or rename files in these folders and update `lib/projects.ts` so the gallery shows them correctly.
